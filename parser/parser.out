Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> statements
Rule 1     statements -> statements statement
Rule 2     statements -> statement
Rule 3     statement -> STATE SYMBOL ARROW STATE SYMBOL DIRECTION

Terminals, with rules where they appear

ARROW                : 3
DIRECTION            : 3
STATE                : 3 3
SYMBOL               : 3 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

statement            : 1 2
statements           : 1 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . statements
    (1) statements -> . statements statement
    (2) statements -> . statement
    (3) statement -> . STATE SYMBOL ARROW STATE SYMBOL DIRECTION

    STATE           shift and go to state 3

    statements                     shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> statements .
    (1) statements -> statements . statement
    (3) statement -> . STATE SYMBOL ARROW STATE SYMBOL DIRECTION

    STATE           shift and go to state 3

    statement                      shift and go to state 4

state 2

    (2) statements -> statement .

    STATE           reduce using rule 2 (statements -> statement .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (statements -> statement .)


state 3
